# PointOfSale

This is my final project for my LaunchCode Java Development class. I wanted to create a Point of Sale system that could be
utilized by tablets and mobile devices in order to improve the customer experience of brick and mortar stores.

## Overview
Once this is completed. Retailers should be able to manage all aspects of their business through this program. Aside from 
just sales. Shipping/Receiving, Hiring and maintaining employees and their time cards, and even communication between stores
in the case of multiple locations should all be handled from the store tablets.

## Technologies
- Java
- Bootstrap 
- Hibernate and MySQL
- To increase as more technologies are used.

## E.T.A. of completion
I hope to have a fully functioning version for release in two years. Right now basic sales, receiving, search, and employee
hiring and termination are in place. Hoping to continue to build and implement features over that time.
